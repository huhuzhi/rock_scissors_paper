rock_scissors_paper
Write a C Program that will allow you to play a user determined number of games of rock,
scissors, paper ( 石头, 剪刀, 布 ) against the computer. The game should ask for the players
name. The game should draw pictures of the rock the paper and the scissors to show what the
player and computer have selected. After the chosen number of games have been played, the
program should determine who won or if it was a draw and output the information on the
screen. The printing of each output selection and the generation of the computers selection
should each be carried out in separate functions (not in function main()). The final win lose or
draw result for the match can be determined and printed from either main() or another
function.
